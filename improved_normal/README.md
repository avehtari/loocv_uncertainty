Script `unbiased.py` runs the respective simulated experiment for the unbiased estimator and plots the results.
Script `test_unfixed.py` is an experimental test for using the same estimator for the Bayesian normal model with unfixed variance parameter.
Script `explore_ratio.py` can be used to inspect the resulting variances of the estimators as a function of various parametrisations of the problem setup.
