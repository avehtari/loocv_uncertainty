# Experiment for analysing the uncertainty in LOO-CV

This repository contains multiple experiments that all consider the problem of estimating the uncertainty in leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) in the context of Bayesian model comparison and evaluation.
These experiments are related to the following two publications:

1. Tuomas Sivula, Måns Magnusson, and Aki Vehtari. (2020) Uncertainty in Bayesian leave-one-out cross-validation based model comparison. arXiv preprint arXiv:2008.10296. URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10296. 2020.
2. Tuomas Sivula, Måns Magnusson, and Aki Vehtari. (2020) Unbiased estimator for the variance of the leave-one-out cross-validation estimator for a Bayesian normal model with fixed variance. arXiv preprint arXiv:2008.10859. URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10859. 2020.

The results related to the Publication 1 can be found in folders `analytic` and `simulated`. The results related to the Publication 2 can be found in folder `improved_normal`.
